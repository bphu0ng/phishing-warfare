## Overview
**Phishing Warfare** is a cybersecurity project developed under the ICT Innovation framework.  
The project focuses on detecting and analyzing phishing emails using **machine learning (ML)** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.  

The goal is to build an automated system that identifies malicious or deceptive messages with high accuracy, supporting detection of phishing attempts in email environments.

## Objectives
**- Classify emails as **phishing** or **legitimate** based on text content and metadata.  
**- Explore correlations between linguistic and structural features of phishing messages.  
- Develop a reproducible ML pipeline for phishing detection that can be adapted to real-world datasets.  
- Visualize patterns and relationships to explain model decisions.

## Key Features
- **Feature Extraction**: Tokenization, TF-IDF, and other text preprocessing techniques.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, and others for comparison.  
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, confusion matrices for model evaluation.  
- **Dataset Management**: Custom dataset loading and preprocessing pipeline.  
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
